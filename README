PrettyDate - Drupal Module

This module was meant for Drupal 7.x and makes use of the Features module.
It adds a formatter using a strongar. This may be easier/better to do using field_formatter hooks. 

It makes use of John Resig's Prettydate formatter but is modified so it works on dates older than 2 weeks old.
